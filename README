 Featherdrop has been written by j4jackj in pure Tcl to satisfy the needs of a
                             diverse IRCer's world.

 It is not better or worse than the bot it is modelled on. It is available as a
             TclServ module as well as as a standalone client-bot.

 It is light on system resources, and uses the proven Tcllib library developed
                        by a rather kind Tcl community.

 Featherdrop is compatible with Eggdrop scripts, and easy to configure. TclServ
              is a services framework developed by j4jackj in Tcl.

   You can run Featherdrop in TclServ either as a clientbot onto a different
  network (useful for relays; this system fakes a botnet to be compatible with
 existing scripts), or as a services clone, in which case it generates a random
                              not-in-use numeric.

 You can also run Featherdrop standalone, as described above. This has a simple
   botnet system which allows it to link to a TclServ-Featherdrop as well as
                              normal featherdrops.

Featherdrop requires no compilation apart from that necessary to install Tcl8.5
 if you don't already have it. Your existing Eggdrop configurations should work
   in Featherdrop with little to no modification. Featherdrop's interface is
largely identical to Eggdrop for the user's perspective, but Featherdrop canNOT
    use Eggdrop userfiles. It may in a later release be able to import them,
                           however, and export them.

                        Thanks for reading this README.
